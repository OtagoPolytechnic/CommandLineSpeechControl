##Command Line Speech Control

## Overview 
The goal of this project is to make a free software tool that allows control of a command line interface through voice commands for people with handicaps.

## Background
Users with motor disability are often unable or severely handicapped to use their hands to interact with a computer. Therefore, using tools that require heavy use of the hands such as the command line interface is unfeasible or impossible for such users. 

##Motivation 
As well as being part of a third year BIT project, the main motivation behind the program is for handicapped or challenged people to be able to control the command line whithout having to pay unreasonable prices. Our software is free and anyone can contribute, this is a completely open source.

##Installation 
To build this software on your computer, you will require the following: 
- Python 2.5 or higher 
- A high quality microphone or heasdset to improve the speech recognition
